# Fulfillment-Based Order Tracking Implementation

## Overview
Updated the Order Management System (OMS) to show **only fulfilled products with PostEx tracking IDs** and display appropriate status messages for orders that aren't delivered yet.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Order Filtering Logic**
- **Before**: Showed all orders with fallback to order names for tracking
- **After**: Only shows orders with actual fulfillments that have PostEx tracking numbers

```typescript
// Filter orders to only show those with PostEx fulfillments
const fulfilledOrdersWithTracking = orders.filter((order) => {
  return order.fulfillments && 
         order.fulfillments.length > 0 && 
         order.fulfillments.some((fulfillment) => 
           fulfillment.tracking_number && 
           fulfillment.tracking_company === "PostEx"
         );
});
```

### 2. **Tracking Number Extraction**
Now extracts tracking numbers directly from the `fulfillments` array:

```typescript
// Extract tracking numbers from fulfillments
const trackingNumbers = fulfilledOrdersWithTracking
  .map((order) => {
    const fulfillment = order.fulfillments.find((f) => 
      f.tracking_number && f.tracking_company === "PostEx"
    );
    return fulfillment?.tracking_number;
  })
  .filter(Boolean);
```

### 3. **Status Display Logic**
Updated status text to show "Pending Shipment in Progress" for non-delivered orders:

```typescript
const getStatusText = (order) => {
  if (order.currentStatus) {
    const statusInfo = postexAPI.getStatusInfo(
      order.currentStatus.transactionStatusMessageCode
    );
    if (statusInfo.type === "delivered") {
      return order.currentStatus.transactionStatusMessage;
    } else {
      // If not delivered, show "Pending Shipment in Progress"
      return "Pending Shipment in Progress";
    }
  }
  return "Pending Shipment in Progress";
};
```

## Fulfillment Structure Support

The implementation now properly handles the Shopify fulfillment structure as provided:

```json
{
  "fulfillments": [
    {
      "id": 5600588759342,
      "tracking_company": "PostEx",
      "tracking_number": "21032470001639",
      "status": "success",
      "line_items": [
        {
          "fulfillment_status": "fulfilled",
          "name": "Pantene Pro-V Oil Replacement Smooth & Silky"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## User Experience Changes

### **Before**
- Showed all orders (fulfilled and unfulfilled)
- Used order names as fallback tracking numbers
- Displayed generic status messages

### **After**
- **Only shows fulfilled orders** with actual PostEx tracking numbers
- **Extracts real tracking numbers** from fulfillment data
- **Shows "Pending Shipment in Progress"** for non-delivered orders
- **Shows actual delivery status** for delivered orders

## Components Updated

1. **OrderManagementSystem.tsx**
   - Updated filtering logic to only show fulfilled orders
   - Added helper function to extract tracking numbers from fulfillments
   - Modified status display logic for pending vs delivered orders
   - Updated empty state message to clarify what orders are shown

2. **Status Mapping**
   - Delivered orders: Show actual PostEx status (e.g., "Delivered to Customer")
   - Non-delivered orders: Show "Pending Shipment in Progress"

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Data**: Only shows orders that actually have tracking information
2. **Clear Status**: Users can easily distinguish between pending and delivered orders
3. **Real Tracking**: Uses actual PostEx tracking numbers instead of fallbacks
4. **Better UX**: Clear messaging about what orders are displayed

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Navigate to **"Order Tracking"** in the app menu
2. Only orders with `fulfillments` containing `tracking_company: "PostEx"` will be shown
3. Orders not yet delivered will show "Pending Shipment in Progress"
4. Delivered orders will show the actual delivery status
5. Use tracking number `21032470001639` to test with the sample data

## Status Mapping

| PostEx Status | Display Text |
|---------------|--------------|
| Code 0005 (Delivered) | "Delivered to Customer" |
| Code 0004 (Out for Delivery) | "Pending Shipment in Progress" |
| Code 0003 (In Transit) | "Pending Shipment in Progress" |
| Code 0001 (At Warehouse) | "Pending Shipment in Progress" |
| Any Non-Delivered | "Pending Shipment in Progress" |

This implementation ensures that **only products that are fulfilled and have tracking IDs are shown**, and **orders that don't have delivered status show "Pending Shipment in Progress"** as requested.
